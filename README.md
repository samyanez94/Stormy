# Stormy
Stormy is a weather application for iOS built on Swift. The app displays the current temperature, humidity, and precipitation data using the [Dark Sky Weather API](https://darksky.net/dev). I built this app as a way to learn more about iOS networking, concurrency, and asynchronous calls in Swift.
